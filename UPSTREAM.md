# QUIC and HTTP/3 maintenance

Baseline: official [quic-go v0.65.0](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/tree/v0.65.0),
commit `aa265c3fc6489e3bfa8071b333be95e0e887a51d`. Go 1.27+.
Pins are recorded in [upstream.json](upstream.json).

The module is `github.com/enetx/quic-go`. Imports are mechanically renamed so Surf
can depend on a published fork without requiring its users to add replacements.
The HTTP/3 package retains Surf's ordered SETTINGS and request headers, local
header limits and stream-priority adapters. HTTP types come from `enetx/http`.
The stateless header sorter is shared through `enetx/http/headerorder`; there is
no second implementation here.

## Ownership

The fork contains protocol controls, no browser names, presets or browser-valued
defaults. All profiles, template construction, GREASE policy and extension values
belong in Surf. QUIC does not depend on uTLS. `tlsquic` is a small interface
using standard-library TLS event types; Surf owns the TLS implementation adapter.

`Config.ClientHandshake == nil` preserves upstream client behavior. Servers keep
the upstream TLS path. Controls are per configuration/connection, never globals.
Known parameter values stay coupled to the engine: stream credit configures the
actual receive controllers; UDP limits provision real receive buffers; ACK delay
sets the receive scheduler; CID and datagram limits configure their validators.
Raw additional parameters may only describe extensions outside engine ownership.
Advertising an extension does not implement it.

## Concurrency corrections

The 0-RTT outgoing-stream fix follows the proposed upstream
[PR #6011](https://github.com/quic-go/quic-go/pull/6011), reviewed at
`ec20e6e567f417325633c6aedc4810b216fc4230`. It was **not merged** at import.
Keep this correction separate from the pinned release baseline and remove it
when an official update includes the same behavior.

Outgoing maps retain applied send windows and RESET_STREAM_AT capability under
their existing locks. Creating a stream no longer reads the parameter pointer
that the handshake can replace, or uses larger newly received limits before
handshake completion. Existing MAX_STREAM_DATA increases remain effective.
The corresponding upstream regression tests are included.

A local stress regression also reproduced a pointer race in SendDatagram;
ConnectionState accesses the same pointer. Publication and these reads use the existing
connection-state mutex; nil parameters reject datagrams normally. No browser
values, presets or new configuration options are involved.

## Small hooks

| Extension | Own implementation | Existing source hooks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Client controls, per-attempt factories, receive windows, datagram/CID/ACK limits, Initial ID/number | `client_handshake.go` | `interface.go`, `config.go`, `connection.go`, `transport.go` |
| Explicit local initial RTT and initial PTO factor, measured-RTT metadata | client controls; `initial_rtt_test.go`, `internal/utils/initial_estimate_test.go` | one client initialization hook; optional fields in `RTTStats`; atomic measurement flag and `ConnectionStats.RTTMeasured` |
| UDP receive size (including the omitted protocol default) | `packet_receive_size*.go` | `sys_conn*.go`, `transport.go`, one receive-only pool branch in `buffer_pool.go` |
| ACK scheduling and active CID limits | `internal/ackhandler/receive_config.go`, client controls | one tracker field/alarm hook and the manager limit hook |
| Optional client receive ACK policy | `ack_policy.go`, `internal/ackhandler/ack_policy.go` | one Application Data tracker branch and client setup; native and server defaults retained |
| Dynamic QPACK receive tables and bounded feedback | `internal/qpack/`, `http3/qpack.go`, `read_stream_wait.go` | HTTP/3 stream/connection decoder adapters |
| Optional QPACK stream order, type timing and encoder capacity announcements | `http3/qpack_client.go` | one transport option, client setup, peer SETTINGS and request header/trailer hooks |
| Ordered/additional client parameters and external GREASE | `transportparams/` | one field and return adapter in `internal/wire/transport_parameters.go` |
| External TLS client | `tlsquic/` | client-only factory and error propagation in `internal/handshake/crypto_setup.go` |
| Initial SETTINGS before request writes / optional first-flight staging | `http3/client_settings.go`, `http3/client_initial_settings.go` | readiness channel, nonblocking control preparation and per-dial application-ready callback |
| HTTP/3 ordering and priority | `http3/` custom files and existing small hooks | see `http3/UPSTREAM.md` |
| First HTTP/3 body read and cancellation of blocked uploads | `http3/request_body_reads.go` | optional wire callback, validated header collection and body-copy hooks |
| Encoded packet-number length and recovery-driven ACK-only probes | `packet_policy.go`, `internal/ackhandler/client_packet_policy.go` | send-handler length/MTU hooks and one client packer branch; callbacks stay outside the engine |
| Optional Initial datagram padding, separated handshake ACK flight and NEW_CONNECTION_ID order | `initial_datagram_padding.go`, `connection_id_frame_order.go` | client packer options, Initial padding accounting and a control-queue ordering branch |
| Optional client Initial protection, address-based packet size, ACK-only PING and receive-credit batching | `initial_packet_protection.go`, `client_handshake.go` | packet serialization/handshake hooks, per-client flow-controller divisor; no browser defaults |

A separate upstream bug fix in `crypto_stream.go` sorts absent SNI cuts after
real ECH cuts. ECH without SNI (IP origins) otherwise leaves HasData false and
stalls the handshake. A byte-reassembly regression covers this case.

`InitialRTT` seeds local RTT/pacing/recovery until a real ACK measurement;
`InitialPTOMultiplier` optionally controls PTO before that first measurement.
Zero fields retain native behavior, including token restoration. Real samples
replace estimates, path migration forgets the old estimate, and clones retain
the explicit policy. No transport parameter or browser value is added here.
`ConnectionStats.RTTMeasured` distinguishes an observed RTT from an initial/token
estimate, including measured paths whose RTT variance has reached zero. Its
underlying flag is atomic so the public statistics API remains safe to read.

Test-only adaptations: HTTP integration tests/examples use fork HTTP types and
ordered maps. `hkdf_test.go` uses fixed Expand-Label vectors instead of private
crypto/tls linknames rejected by Go 1.27. The config-field audit includes the new
optional field. Keep upstream tests with their source packages when private
access is required; public extension tests live under `tests/`.
Malformed QPACK peers wait for a request before injecting an error, avoiding a
legitimate pre-request transport retry. Stream cancellation completion waits
use the integration suite's time scale and retain all cancellation assertions.

## Audit and update

`python3 scripts/upstream.py audit` compares with the pinned Git source after
normalizing module/HTTP imports and gofmt. `audit --patch` shows the substantive
patch. New extension files are listed separately. This requires `gofmt` on PATH.
The script is a maintenance tool, not a runtime dependency.

Before updating, commit reviewed local changes. Fetch the new upstream tag and
create a separate Git worktree from the fork's HEAD. Merge the tag there with
`--no-commit --no-ff`; resolve the small hooks using the inventory above. Normalize
new upstream package imports to `github.com/enetx/quic-go`, and HTTP/3/integration
HTTP imports to `github.com/enetx/http`. Keep source links pointing upstream.
Update the pin only after reviewing and testing the merged candidate. Never merge
upstream changes directly over an uncommitted Surf working tree.

Validation:

```sh
go mod tidy
go test -race -count=1 ./...
go vet ./...
python3 scripts/upstream.py audit
```

Also run Surf's full race/coverage command and independent Initial-packet wire
tests against the candidate. Check that nil controls retain upstream behavior,
custom values reach the peer, session metadata survives resumption, invalid TLS
templates fail explicitly, and HTTP/1/2 fixtures remain unchanged.

## Module boundaries

Surf imports HTTP/3 from `github.com/enetx/quic-go/http3` and uses released
HTTP and QUIC modules. Local replacements are optional development overrides.
HTTP/3 source and tests live only in this module. The duplicate implementation
was removed from the HTTP module after migration and regression comparison.

Published versions depend on the released HTTP module with its exported sorter.
No local replacement is needed by module consumers. Release HTTP changes first
when QUIC needs a new shared HTTP API, then release QUIC and update Surf.

The fork owns `.github/workflows/go.yml`: Go 1.27 checks formatting, module
consistency, the complete race-enabled suite and vet on Linux, macOS and Windows.
Upstream Docker publishing, cloud fuzzing and third-party upload workflows are
not installed in the fork; they require upstream-specific credentials/services.

## Verified behavior and remaining limits

The receive-side dynamic QPACK implementation follows RFC 9204. It reuses the
unchanged official qpack module for the static table/outbound encoder and x/net's
Huffman codec. Capacity, blocked streams, decoded header size and feedback queues
are bounded. Cancellation, deadlines, connection shutdown and critical-stream
errors retain native QUIC semantics. Zero capacity keeps the upstream static path.
RFC Appendix B vectors, fragmented instructions, table eviction/wrap, blocked
streams, errors, cancellation and real HTTP/3 client/server exchanges are tested.
Outbound dynamic encoding now lives in `internal/qpack/encoder.go`. It reuses
official static-table entries and x/net Huffman coding, without another dependency
fork. Generic options select indexing, strings, Base, instruction names, draining,
and bounded outstanding sections; browser choices remain in Surf.

`http3.QPACKConfig` optionally reserves encoder/decoder streams in application
order, sends their types eagerly or with their first instruction, and queues an
encoder capacity announcement after SETTINGS or with the next HEADERS block.
The value never exceeds the peer's limit or the configured local budget; absent
or zero peer capacity keeps requests static. Zero announcements are optional.
One writer per critical stream
preserves instruction order and respects flow control without blocking request
headers or the control parser. Feedback queues remain bounded. Nil configuration
retains native behavior, and server behavior is unchanged. Browser values and
mode selection belong in Surf; the fork contains no browser detection or sleeps.
The protocol matrix, reserved IDs, lazy type bytes, capacity bounds, snapshots,
limited stream credit, critical-stream STOP_SENDING and dynamic response feedback
are tested in `tests/http3/qpack_client_test.go`.

Surf now owns independent Chrome 157 / Firefox 160 QUIC ClientHello fixtures.
Its tests decrypt Initial packets independently and compare TLS, ordered SETTINGS,
headers and supported transport parameters. Manual warmed requests to the external
HTTP/3 endpoint pass, including the Firefox response that previously exposed the
dynamic-QPACK gap. The external endpoint is not a CI dependency.

This does not establish complete browser identity. Upstream quic-go lacks
compatible in-flight version negotiation. This fork now adds opt-in client
v1/v2 switching with authenticated validation; see Client version negotiation
below. Native server negotiation policy remains unchanged.
The native ACK_FREQUENCY parser has different last-field semantics from the
legacy format. The fork exposes an isolated opt-in legacy receiver and local
min_ack_delay advertisement; see below. It does not generate adaptive requests
for the peer's ACK rate.
ACK ratio/frequency, packet scheduling/coalescing, congestion/loss behavior and
resource-specific priority policy still differ from browser engines. Browser
defaults and workaround decisions belong in Surf.

The outgoing encoder commits a section only after its complete instruction batch
is accepted by the bounded writer. Backpressure falls back to static encoding,
without references to unsent insertions. Eviction protects unacknowledged entries,
outstanding references and references acquired in the current section. RIC modulo
uses the peer's SETTINGS maximum independently from the chosen capacity. Feedback
is FIFO per stream, with separate section ACK, cancellation and increment handling.
Request trailers share the connection encoder and deterministic header ordering.
Without encoder-stream credit, sections remain static until the critical stream
can open; queued capacity instructions cannot create references to unsendable data.

State management was cross-checked against the independent Go implementation in
[`mach`](https://github.com/Lemon4ksan/mach/tree/17ea25018f3b1d8a2810f4f409974d225a6eb2bb/proto/codec/qpack)
and RFC 9204. It is a reference, not a new module dependency. The implementation
remains isolated here; static/Huffman tables and browser policies are not copied.

`tests/qpack/encoder_test.go` and `encoder_fuzz_test.go` cover native static bytes,
independent wire vectors, Huffman/N bits, both Base forms, wrapping, eviction,
duplication, tracking/blocking budgets, backpressure rollback, partial/invalid
feedback, concurrency and options. `tests/http3/qpack_encoder_test.go` exercises
real HTTP/3 connections, concurrent bodies/trailers and connection-level errors.
Surf's separate browser audit compares raw QPACK blocks and encoder instructions.

The connection-migration regression checks STREAM packet tuples after a switch;
late validation responses may still use a nondefault tuple. Explicit probe,
packet-count, address and connection-ID unlinkability assertions are retained.

Client receive ACK policy is now configurable: initial/decimated packet thresholds,
transition by packet-number span, RTT-scaled delay and floor, fixed earliest deadline,
gap-window/immediate reordering and ECN response. Browser policy remains in Surf.
The native tracker branch and Initial/Handshake spaces are preserved. Policy is
cloned per configuration and connection. These local controls do not negotiate ACK_FREQUENCY; the separate opt-in legacy
receiver is described below. They do not change congestion control, packet pacing
or version switching.
Deterministic `internal/ackhandler/ack_policy_test.go` cases cover boundary numbers,
non-eliciting packets, timer expiry, real RTT samples, gaps, ECN and snapshots.

Optional client packet controls remain independent of receive ACK scheduling.
`InitialPacketProtection` fragments/reorders actual CRYPTO and distributes the
existing padding budget. The multi-packet layout preserves stream offsets and
native fragment retransmission handlers. Configuration is snapshotted per
connection; browser values and policies remain in Surf. Property tests cover
partial ClientHello writes, packet budgets, large messages, recovery and later
TLS messages.

`ReceiveWindowUpdateDivisor` applies to real stream/connection controllers.
`AckOnlyPingThreshold` can retain, replace or disable periodic PING insertion.
`AckOnlyMaxDataThreshold` queues a repeat of current connection credit to solicit
an ACK, without increasing credit. `OmitInitialAckOnHandshake` omits an ACK-only
Initial only when Handshake data/keys are ready. Initial DCID length and
address-based UDP-size factories run per dial attempt; errors/invalid results
fail before packet emission. Default client/server behavior remains native.

Optional `PacketNumberLengthPolicy` receives a recovery snapshot and selects encoded
bytes. Invalid lengths fall back to native; too-short lengths are increased to
retain a safe decoding range. Server policies are never installed. The handler
tracks the current datagram size for congestion-window estimates.
`AckProbePolicy` receives tracked application-data packet count (including
ACK-only sends), last eliciting send age and unbacked-off PTO. It only adds a
PING to an ACK-bearing packet when congestion and packet space permit it; native
PTO recovery remains independent. Lost-packet retention still follows quic-go.

`DisableConnectionIDRotation` suppresses unsolicited changes on the current path,
including the first post-handshake change. Peer retirement and path migration
remain mandatory and have explicit regressions. `OnApplicationReady` is a
nonblocking staging callback after verified TLS and applied peer parameters,
before releasing `HandshakeComplete`. It must never call blocking stream writes
or `CloseWithError`. HTTP/3 uses `TryWriteAll` and hands blocked writes to a goroutine.

`InitialPaddingMode` optionally moves the datagram size padding outside coalesced
long-header packets. Header-protection sample padding remains encrypted. A final
short-header packet instead receives encrypted padding because its ciphertext
extends to the UDP boundary; appending plaintext would invalidate AEAD. Datagram
padding is charged to the Initial sent-packet size, while qlog packet lengths
remain their actual encoded lengths. Initial probes and close packets use the
same policy. Servers and zero-valued client controls keep native behavior.

`HandshakeAckBeforeData` optionally packs queued Initial/Handshake ACKs before
consuming local Handshake CRYPTO. The ACK-only prefix never includes application
data. Native disposal of Initial keys on the first Handshake send then allows the
following Finished flight to remain unpadded. There is no injected timer, TLS
verification bypass or asynchronous TLS-engine modification. Certificate
verification still completes synchronously; this reproduces flight composition,
not NSS authentication latency.

`SortConnectionIDFrames` controls the NEW_CONNECTION_ID subsequence independently
of other frame types. Queue admission preserves ascending order across packet
budgets, and serialization restores it after native control-frame shuffling.
Every frame moves with its loss/ACK handler. Default queues and servers retain
native ordering. Unit tests cover packet budgets and 100 shuffle seeds; live
transport tests cover each padding/ACK combination, rejected certificates,
0-RTT acceptance/rejection and loss of each of the first three outgoing datagrams.

HTTP/3 also accepts a per-connection `WireConfig.SettingsGrease` factory. Reserved
identifier validation and ordered snapshotting are isolated in
`http3/settings_grease.go`; browser distributions remain outside the engine.

## Optional packet-number spaces

`ClientHandshake.SeparatePacketNumberSpaces` keeps wire generators and histories
for Initial, Handshake and Application Data independently. Only Initial receives
the configured starting number; the other spaces start at zero.
`DisablePacketNumberSkipping` suppresses random and PTO-induced Application Data
gaps; the default preserves native skipping and skipped-ACK rejection. 0-RTT and 1-RTT
share the Application Data space. The default remains the native shared counter.

The isolated `internal/ackhandler/packet_number_spaces.go` selects histories.
`packet.CongestionNumber` is a separate monotonic transmission sequence, used
only for congestion/recovery callbacks; qlog, ACKs, ECN and retransmission
bookkeeping retain wire numbers. Lost-packet entries preserve congestion IDs
for later spurious-loss reports. Counts across histories still enforce native
packet-storage limits. Retry and migration do not reset wire generators.
Tests cover overlapping numbers, ACK isolation, unsent/skipped ACK rejection,
0-RTT rejection, Retry, key disposal, loss/undo and migration. Surf's Chromium
profile deliberately keeps shared allocation; its Firefox profile enables the
independent spaces after verification of the respective browser sources.

## Legacy ACK_FREQUENCY receive mode

`ClientHandshake.LegacyAckFrequencyMinDelay` enables receive support and emits
local parameter 0xff02de1a. Zero retains native parsing and advertisement; positive
whole-microsecond values must fit the configured max_ack_delay. Profiles and the
chosen minimum remain in Surf. `Config.LegacyAckFrequencyMinDelay` also enables
the same receiver on either endpoint, including opt-in test servers. The existing
client-only value overrides it when nonzero. Sender policy is independent.

`internal/wire/legacy_ack_frequency_frame.go` isolates the three-varint plus
single-byte ignore_order format. It is deliberately separate from the existing
newer draft parser. Legacy mode accepts it only in 1-RTT and does not enable
IMMEDIATE_ACK. Tolerance zero and flags other than 0/1 are frame errors; requested
delay below the local advertised minimum is a protocol violation. Oversized delay
conversion and alarm deadlines saturate without integer wrap.

The tracker uses the requested tolerance, delay and ordering flag after the first
valid update. Equal sequence numbers replace state, older sequences are ignored,
and an already pending ACK deadline is retained. Initial/Handshake trackers and
native behavior when unset are preserved. Source references:
[Firefox legacy frame parser](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/blob/FIREFOX_160_0_RELEASE/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/src/frame.rs),
[receiver validation](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/blob/FIREFOX_160_0_RELEASE/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/src/connection/mod.rs), and
[sequence/timer rules](https://github.com/mozilla-firefox/firefox/blob/FIREFOX_160_0_RELEASE/third_party/rust/neqo-transport/src/tracking.rs).

Transport-parameter layout preserves this known engine field even though its
number is congruent to 27 modulo 31. Public custom-parameter injection remains
forbidden for engine-owned IDs. Private parser/tracker tests, independent Neqo
bytes, qlog serialization and real client/server frame injection cover the mode,
including disabled and invalid-delay connection errors. Surf additionally decrypts
Initial bytes to verify the Firefox advertisement, ordering, overrides and opt-out.

## Outgoing legacy ACK_FREQUENCY

`ClientHandshake.PeerAckFrequencyPolicy` enables a per-connection controller only
after the actual handshake and an opted-in decode of peer parameter 0xff02de1a.
Native clients still ignore this parameter. Capability is not saved for 0-RTT.
The callback supplies policy from the application's live congestion window,
datagram size and smoothed RTT; browser constants and hysteresis remain in Surf.
Nil retains native behavior. Callbacks must be concurrency safe across connections
and must not block or reenter a connection.

`peer_ack_frequency.go` isolates sequencing, packet budgets and frame delivery.
Only one request is outstanding; loss allows a new sequence with the latest
target instead of retransmitting stale settings. Late feedback cannot clear a
newer outstanding request or restore an older acknowledged state. Recovery uses
the maximum of current, target and sent-but-unconfirmed delay, and rearms PTO on
changes. The unconfirmed high-water bound is deliberately conservative compared
with Neqo's current/target bound; it clears when the latest request is acknowledged.
Targets must have a positive QUIC integer tolerance and a whole-microsecond delay
at least the peer minimum and at most 16383ms, the engine's max_ack_delay range.
Invalid callback results close the local connection.

`ClientHandshake.InitialCongestionWindowPackets` exposes only the initial window
(zero retains native defaults; explicit range 2..10000). Migration restores that
configured window against the new accounting segment size. The optional
congestion selectors described below extend this constructor; the native default
remains Reno with the original HyStart and native pacing. Tests cover independent wire bytes, real negotiated
and unnegotiated connections, invalid policies, delayed feedback, sequence
exhaustion, packet budgets, PTO rearming, migration and non-resumption of capability.

## HTTP/3 connection preparation

`http3/transport_preconnect.go` adds `Transport.Preconnect(ctx, hostPort)` using
the transport's existing dial coalescing, client factory, SETTINGS setup and pool.
It waits for a verified handshake, including when the underlying dial uses early
data, without sending a request. Failed or canceled preparation removes/closes an
attempt only when no other pool user holds it. A shared dial survives cancellation
of one waiting caller. Successful preparation leaves the connection in the normal
pool; idle cleanup and Close retain ownership. `PreconnectEarly` exposes the
same pool entry when early keys are ready, returning its transport-owned Conn;
it neither sends an HTTP request nor treats early readiness as authentication.
Cold connections still wait for the handshake. Tests cover real HTTP/3 reuse,
shared cancellation and a gated resumable handshake.

With `CoalesceInitialSettings`, the small dial hook in `http3/transport.go`
keeps setup per candidate connection. A custom address dialer can invoke several
application-ready callbacks and return a different winner. Setup must follow
that winner, rather than the first callback; temporary candidate references are
released when dial completes. A two-candidate regression reproduces the failure
with the old single sync.Once and passes with candidate-specific setup.

Protocol competition, timers, browser policy and body ownership remain in Surf.

`SessionVersion` and `ClientSessionMetadata` read the existing client-side
session-state metadata block. Its local format revision is 7: negotiated version,
measured RTT (zero without a sample), Initial key-context CID and remembered
transport parameters. Revisions 5 and 6 remain readable for ordinary
resumption/0-RTT; version-bearing revision 6 has no RTT or CID. Returned byte
slices are snapshots. The number and order of application Extra entries are
preserved. This metadata never changes the opaque server ticket or TLS wire
format. Generic metadata, malformed/legacy states and authenticated compatible
switches are tested. Choosing an initial version from a live ticket remains
Surf policy, including origin isolation, allowed versions, cache eviction and
expiry; the QUIC engine does not add an origin-history database.

`ClientHandshake.OnEarlyDataRejected` observes the client's existing TLS
0-RTT rejection event before its encryption level is discarded. The callback
runs on the connection loop and must return promptly without reentering it.
Surf uses it to update its remaining ticket queue; no browser cache policy or
origin database enters this fork. Standard TLS and custom TLS-engine rejection
paths are exercised by Surf's actual HTTP/3 handshake tests.

## Client congestion control

`ClientHandshake.CongestionControl` selects native Reno, explicit Reno,
RFC 9438 CUBIC with whole-segment ACK credit, or fixed-point byte-mode CUBIC.
`SlowStart` selects original HyStart or classic byte growth (not HyStart++).
`CongestionControlSegmentSize` can fix the accounting segment independently of
UDP MTU; zero follows MTU. Byte-mode `CongestionControlConnections` configures
connection emulation. Browser choices and all preset values remain in Surf.

The RFC controller is isolated in `internal/congestion/cubic_rfc9438.go`.
ACK-frame batching and send-time window utilization preserve byte accounting
when delayed ACKs cover several packets. Loss reduces by 0.7; ECN uses 0.85;
spurious-loss undo restores the curve, ACK credit and saved window. Byte-mode
CUBIC supports an explicit segment size and matches QUICHE's unsigned intermediates
and conversion after the floating-point addition. The upstream Reno-friendly test
helper is adjusted to that corrected rounding; independent C++ vectors validate it.
Migration recreates the configured controller; timeout resets its transient state.
Client options are ignored by server constructors. Defaults and server behavior
retain their native defaults. Optional scheduling and recovery controls are
described below; these mechanisms do not establish full browser recovery parity. The source-derived suites execute 1120 original Neqo and
540 original QUICHE controller vectors; their provenance and runners are in
`internal/congestion/testdata`. They are not browser packet captures.

## Client version negotiation

`ClientHandshake.CompatibleVersionNegotiation` enables RFC 9368 / RFC 9369
v1/v2 switching and authenticated version negotiation checks. Native clients
and server policy retain their defaults. `Config.Versions` supplies permitted
versions and the initial version; a client layout may provide parameter 0x11
with per-connection preference / GREASE. The engine validates and promotes that
parameter into the typed codec, retaining its position and exact version values.
No browser preferences are embedded in the fork.

`compatible_version.go` owns selection guards, alternate Initial verification,
server version-information checks and version-scoped token keys. It uses the
existing bounded undecryptable-packet queue for reordered Handshake packets.
Initial keys and packet key labels change only after a candidate Initial passes
AEAD verification. The first server CRYPTO locks the version. Initial PN space,
TLS transcript, congestion state and Retry's current key CID are retained.
`ConnectionState.Version` reports the negotiated version. An authenticated
mismatch, unavailable choice or induced downgrade fails with transport error 0x11.
Malformed version information fails with TRANSPORT_PARAMETER_ERROR; the TLS
error wrapper now preserves existing transport errors instead of masking them
as INTERNAL_ERROR. The RFC 9368
section 8 exception for old v1-only servers is covered.

The handshake's isolated helper changes packet key labels and scopes client
session-cache keys to the negotiated version. Packet packing retains original
version headers and keys for 0-RTT after a switch. NEW_TOKEN entries are likewise
isolated by version. A ticket from v2 is not offered by an original v1 connection;
choosing the next connection's original version from browser history is separate
application policy. No TLS library fork is required.

Private-package tests cover both directions, Retry, an original-version ACK,
reordered Handshake, a lost flight, corrupted candidate packets, classic VN and
VN followed by compatible switching, old servers, malformed / contradictory
information, downgrade rejection, PN decoding, 0-RTT packet types, cache isolation
and real TLS application keys. The UDP packet peer drives actual client Dial and
verifies client Finished. Its TLS/packet primitives are native and it is not an
independent implementation of selection. Additional manual HTTP/3 interoperability
checks use unmodified official aioquic 1.3.0, with private test certificates trusted
by the Go clients, covering both directions, Retry and accepted original-version
0-RTT across a switch. Surf preserves the sanitized reference results separately.

## Optional send scheduling and recovery

`ClientHandshake.MaxCongestionWindowPackets` retains the native ceiling at zero,
sets an explicit segment ceiling when positive, and removes that fixed ceiling
at -1. Accounting segment and path MTU remain independent. Integer operations
and packet-history limits still bound the engine; no memory limits are disabled.

`PacingConfig` selects a leaky bucket with signed debt or scheduled pacing with
initial/idle and lumpy bursts. Applications supply gains, burst sizes, bandwidth
threshold and granularity. `ProportionalRateReduction` enables RFC 6937;
`RecoveryBurstPackets` supplies a bounded recovery allowance.
`PersistentCongestionThreshold` requires a contiguous loss interval bounded by
ack-eliciting packets after the first RTT sample; a PTO expiration alone never
collapses the window. Application-limited notifications from empty packet packs
stop the scheduled pacer from accumulating credit during application pauses.

The code is isolated in `internal/congestion/pacing_policy.go`, `recovery.go`,
`internal/ackhandler/persistent_congestion.go` and `client_send_config.go`. The
connection packing path has two optional notification hooks.
`ClientSendConfig` keeps PN/loss bookkeeping separate from congestion arithmetic.
No browser presets, uTLS dependency, DNS resolver or browser sleeps enter this fork.
Browser policy and connection discovery remain in Surf.

In addition to CUBIC reference fixtures, tests execute 120 pacing rows generated
from unmodified Firefox 160 Neqo `pace.rs`, and 40 PRR states (200 allowance
comparisons) from unmodified pinned QUICHE source/header. Go tests need neither
Rust nor C++; reproducible developer runners and hashes are in
`internal/congestion/testdata/README.md`. Surf additionally verifies complete
bidirectional transfers under deterministic packet loss with both profiles.
These are source and transport checks, not proof of identical browser NIC timing.


## Grouped application stream writes

`Conn.TryWriteStreamBatch` stages a bounded list of existing local-stream writes
and optional FINs in one connection-loop turn. It never waits for stream credit
or a competing writer, returns the accepted prefix, and preserves normal packet
size and congestion limits. The generic implementation lives in
`stream_write_batch.go`; the connection loop has one channel and two dispatch
hooks. Default request writes do not use the operation.

Optional `WireConfig.CoalesceRequestHeaders` groups initial priority and HEADERS,
including FIN only for automatically managed bodyless requests. Manual request
streams stay open. The single control writer retains ordering and uses the
asynchronous path under backpressure. Thirty-request packet tests, manual DATA,
flow-control blockage, partial batches and close/error cases are covered.

`QPACKConfig.EncoderCapacityRequiresSetting` distinguishes an omitted peer table
setting from an explicit zero while preserving the independent
EncoderZeroCapacity switch. Browser choices remain exclusively in Surf.
